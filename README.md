[![Buf Checks](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/next-trace/scg-notification-contracts/ci.yml?branch=main&label=buf%20checks)](https://github.com/next-trace/scg-notification-contracts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Canonical, stable Protobuf contracts for SupplyChainGuard (SCG) notifications. These contracts are shared across services and clients to ensure consistent, evolvable event and notification schemas.

- Single source of truth for notification messages and enums used across SCG domains
- Stability first: linting and breaking-change checks enforced via Buf and CI
- Generated Go packages for easy consumption in Go microservices

## Overview

SCG emits domain events (e.g., compliance, logistics, custody). This repository defines notification-oriented contracts that describe how those events are communicated to users and systems across channels (email, SMS, push, webhooks, in-app, digests, escalations). Contracts live under proto/scg/** and are versioned to maintain compatibility.

Key areas covered include:
- Enums for channels, severity, categories, audiences, and statuses
- Models for preferences, deliveries, digests, and core notifications
- Event messages for major supply chain workflows (onboarding, compliance, logistics, digital twin, risk, system, etc.)

## Tooling

This repo uses Buf for linting, breaking-change detection, and code generation.

Install Buf and Go plugins:
- Using Go (simplest, cross-platform):
  - go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest
  - go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
  - go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
- Or see Bufâ€™s docs for other install methods: https://buf.build/docs/installation

Run linting:
- buf lint

Check for breaking changes (compare against main):
- buf breaking --against '.git#branch=main'

You can also run the local helper which wraps the above:
- ./scg proto-gen

Important: JSON naming
- All message fields explicitly set json_name to snake_case across the schemas.
- When serializing to JSON, standard Go/Protobuf JSON marshallers will emit snake_case names.
- Regenerate code after any .proto change to ensure json struct tags are up-to-date:
  - buf generate

Configuration lives in:
- buf.yaml (module name, lint, breaking)
- buf.gen.yaml (codegen plugins and output locations)

## Code Generation (Go)

Generate Go code into gen/go using Buf:
- buf generate

Notes:
- This uses the go and go-grpc plugins configured in buf.gen.yaml
- Ensure protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc are on your PATH (see Tooling)
- Generated packages are laid out under gen/go/proto/scg/... and are importable via the module path

## Usage Example (Go)

In a Go service, add this module:
- go get github.com/next-trace/scg-notification-contracts@vX.Y.Z

Import generated types, for example a shared notification event:

import (
    sharedevents "github.com/next-trace/scg-notification-contracts/gen/go/proto/scg/shared/v1"
)

envelope := &sharedevents.NotificationEventEnvelope{
    EventUuid:    "e7a1c3e4-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678",
    EventType:    "system.maintenance",
    ActorUuid:    "user-123",
    TraceUuid:    "trace-abc",
    SchemaVersion: 1,
}

// Note: All JSON output uses snake_case via explicit json_name options in the .proto files.
// After buf generate, the Go structs include json tags aligned with snake_case.

## Versioning and Stability

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- MAJOR: backward-incompatible changes to protobuf contracts
- MINOR: backward-compatible additions (new messages/fields with sensible defaults)
- PATCH: backward-compatible fixes and clarifications

Consumer guidance:
- Pin to a released tag in go.mod, e.g.: require github.com/next-trace/scg-notification-contracts v1.2.3
- Avoid relying on main in production services
- When upgrading MAJOR versions, run buf breaking against your current tag to assess impact:
  - buf breaking --against '.git#tag=v1.2.3'

## Testing and Quality

- CI runs build, tests, linting, security scans, and protobuf generation
- Buf linting and breaking checks are executed in CI to protect stability

Quick checks locally:
- buf lint
- buf breaking --against '.git#branch=main'
- buf generate
- ./scg ci  # builds, tests, lints, security, and proto generation

## Security

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead, follow the guidance in SECURITY.md (or contact the maintainers privately if that file is not present yet). We aim to respond promptly.

## Changelog

Changes are tracked via Git tags and Git history. When available, see CHANGELOG.md for curated release notes. Each release describes added, changed, and removed contracts to aid safe upgrades.

Focus: This repository is contract-first and stability-focused. Please run Buf checks and avoid breaking changes unless performing a planned MAJOR release.
